/* ============================================================
   HELP LIBRARY, the pet chatbot brain
   Unlocked once every scavenger-hunt treasure is found. The pet
   answers free-text questions by keyword-matching them against
   every tip (base + deep) plus a few special entries.

   Matching is deliberately lightweight: tokenize the question,
   score each entry by how many of its keywords hit with whole-word
   (plus simple plural) comparison, and return the best match. A
   total miss returns the canned topic listing — nothing is ever
   generated. The TREE OF KNOWLEDGE entry only explains the Lab's
   trivia tree; handing out lore lives there, not in this chat.
