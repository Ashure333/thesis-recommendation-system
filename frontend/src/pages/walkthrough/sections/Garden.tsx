        <P>
          The Lab's <Chip>Garden</Chip> tab grows a pixel-art tree from a winged seed to an ancient giant. It is
          the system's playful layer, and it is also functional: the tree teaches one fact about the
          system per question, and growing it past its Young stage unlocks the Pro tabs of My Library.
          Everything in the garden is drawn procedurally on a small canvas and scaled by whole
          pixels, so the art stays crisp at any window size.
        </P>
        <P>
          The garden card is built from a wooden menu at the top, the meadow with the tree and, under
          it, an action bar (<Chip>Ask the tree</Chip>, <Chip>Buy fertilizer</Chip>, <Chip>Reset progress</Chip>).
          A <Chip>Tree info</Chip> panel at the lower left carries the species' dossier, and a button at
          the lower right paints the tree in an alternative color scheme.
        </P>

            The line at the right of the menu names the tree's current stage, its true height and how
            many of its facts it has taught you so far ("Elder tree · 1000 ft · 0/55 learned").

          <P>
            Sun is the currency. You earn it by visiting each day, petting the pet, asking help
            questions, finding treasures, unlocking achievements and discovering tips, and you spend it
            in the Sun shop on fertilizer, which is fed to the tree packet by packet. 3,000 packets take
            a seed to the top of the climb. The stages are equally spaced: Seed, Seedling, Sapling,
            Young, Mature, Giant and Ancient. Every height label is the tree's actual painted height,
            measured against the ancient crown, so 1,000 ft is always a fully grown tree.

            The garden opens at your real progress. The stage chip at the top of the meadow is a
            dropdown: you can preview any stage you have already conquered, and the tree morphs between
            them quickly in both directions (the roots and trunk grow as transitions). You can never
            preview a stage you have not reached. Once the tree is taller than the window, a viewer
            unlocks: drag, scroll or use the arrows at the bottom right to climb up and down the trunk,
            and the button at the top right makes the card full screen.

        <WikiSub id="garden-species" title="Five species, each from its own reference">
          <P>
            Each species has its own leaf shape, bark texture, growth curve, stage lines and charms, drawn
            from its real botany: the maple's palmate five-lobed leaf, the oak's rounded lobes, the
            birch's toothed, pointed oval on white peeling bark, the elm's lopsided leaf and netted
            ridges, the redwood's flat needle sprays on a red fibrous trunk. Branches fork like a
            binary tree, slightly outward, so every crown is different. Higher up the trunk the view
            shows hanging vines, sylphs and sun shafts, and at the summit clouds, twigs and many leaves.
          </P>
          <WikiGallery cols={4} ids={["garden-species-oak", "garden-species-birch", "garden-species-elm", "garden-species-redwood"]} />
          <P>
            Each tree can also be painted in three alternative color schemes (plus its original), chosen
            with the button at the bottom right of the meadow: for the maple Golden Hour, Spring Green and
            Plum Dusk; for the oak Autumn Russet, Frosted Blue and Cherry Blossom; and so on. The choice
            is remembered per species.

          <P>
            Press <Chip>Ask the tree</Chip> and it answers with one fact about the system, in the speech
            bubble beside the crown. Facts unlock with height, so a young tree knows little; later asks
            repeat the facts you already hold. The first three questions in half a minute are always
            answered; ask more and the tree grows impatient and sometimes just says a grumpy line
            ("Don't bother me") instead. The counter in the menu shows how many facts you have learned
            of the species' total. The tree also comments on every purchase and every milestone, with
            lines specific to its species and stage.
          </P>

            <Chip>Tree info</Chip> shows the species dossier (its Latin name, a fact and the research on it);{" "}

          <WikiThumb id="garden-almanac-charms" width={420} />
          <P>
            As the tree grows it unlocks five <Chip>charms</Chip>: living parts of the garden that you can
            switch on and off, at 250, 450, 650, 850 and 1,000 ft. Each has a name, a kind (foliage,
            plant, creature, light and weather, relic) and a cheat word. Open <Chip>Almanac → Charms</Chip>
            and flip a peg, or type the word into the cheat console; a pop-up confirms every switch and
            closes itself after ten seconds. A charm that is still locked shows how many feet remain.
          </P>

            headers={["Species", "250 / 450 / 650 ft", "850 / 1,000 ft", "Names"]}

          <WikiThumb id="garden-charms-on" float="center" width={640} />
          <P>
            The creatures are interactive: click or tap the squirrel, the jay, the woodpecker, the
            oriole or the slug and they react (a chatter, a hop and a flight, a drum roll, a song, a curl).
            The scarlet creeper grows up the trunk as the tree grows.

            <Chip>Almanac → Scene</Chip> is never locked. Twenty switches in four groups (Sky and ground,
            The tree, The climb, Particles) turn clouds, fireflies, the fence and house, tumbling leaves,
            birds, trunk vines, sap glow, hanging vines, sylphs, sun shafts, the crown shadow and the
            summit clouds on and off, with All on and All off buttons. The Particles group (falling
            leaves, pollen, motes of light, haze, specks drifting over the pages) is off by default;
            the treasure glints of the scavenger hunt are on.
