            Re:Search runs as a single-user local application, so the sign-in card accepts any
            well-formed email and any password; nothing is sent to a server and the choice is
            remembered in this browser (tick <Chip>Remember me</Chip> to keep it between
            sessions). <Chip>Create an account</Chip> asks for a name, an email and a password
            of at least eight characters and then behaves exactly like a sign-in.{" "}
            <Chip>Forgot password?</Chip> only explains what a hosted deployment would do.
          </P>
          <P>
            The first time you open the app in a browser session the arcade boot screen plays:
            the title <Chip>RE:SEARCH · BULSU BSMCS THESIS RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM</Chip> types
            itself out, then <Chip>PRESS START</Chip> blinks. Click anywhere or press any key to
            go in. The screen is shown once per session, never again until you close the tab.

            <Chip>/home</Chip> is the front desk. A search box at the top sends whatever you type
            straight to the Repository's Recommend scope, so a first query is one Enter away. Below
            it the library staff's <Chip>Announcements</Chip> are posted (editable from the site
            editor at <Chip>/admin</Chip>), and <Chip>Start here</Chip> offers four cards: Search,
            Repository, My Library and FAQ. In Library mode a banner at the bottom offers the
            switch to Researcher mode.

            Everything after sign-in shares one top bar. From the left: the logo (the slime's face
            and the glitching <Chip>RE:SEARCH</Chip> title), then the page tabs, then at the right
            the <Chip>NERD</Chip> switch and the theme button. Under it an arcade attract ticker
            scrolls status lines such as the active pipeline.

            The whole app works at phone width (shown here at 390 × 844). The top bar drops its
            tab labels and keeps icons only; the bar scrolls sideways for the last tabs
            (Settings, Changelog). Pages stack into one column: the Repository table folds into
            two-line rows (and the ranked results keep just title and score), the inspector opens
            below the list, and the Arena and Lab panels fill the width. The Garden's stage is a
            short 16:9 strip on a phone, so its Tree info card starts folded; the full-screen
            button gives the tree the whole screen. Dragging a citation link onto the Upload box
            shows the same <Chip>DROP HERE</Chip> prompt.

            Presentation mode hosts the product as it would be delivered. Entering it sets every
            local preference aside (skins, cheats, garden progress, layout choices, the Pro
            override) so the site opens exactly as a first-time visitor sees it; nothing is
            deleted, and leaving restores your own settings. Your sign-in is never touched.
          </P>
          <P>
            Inside it the Stats button, theme picker, layout switcher, Stats for Nerds, the pet,
            the cheat console, the garden, the ticker, scanlines and the boot screen are gone. What
            remains is what the study delivers: <Chip>Repository</Chip>, <Chip>Upload</Chip>,{" "}
            <Chip>My Library</Chip> (free tabs only), <Chip>Arena</Chip>, <Chip>Engine</Chip> and{" "}
            <Chip>FAQ</Chip>. Pipelines carry their formal names (TF-IDF, S-BERT + Metadata) in
            place of the arcade codenames, and the Arena says <Chip>Run Arena</Chip> and{" "}
            <Chip>Win tally</Chip>. Any route outside this lineup sends you back to the Repository.
