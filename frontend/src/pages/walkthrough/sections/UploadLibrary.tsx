        <P>
          Upload is the front door for new papers. Every path ends in the same pipeline: extract
          metadata, classify the subject, validate the record for recommendation, generate missing
          keywords, check for duplicates and store it. Nothing is saved until you approve the review
          form, so a bad extraction costs you nothing.

            After a lookup or an extraction the page shows the record in a form: <Chip>Title</Chip>,{" "}
            <Chip>Authors</Chip>, <Chip>Abstract</Chip>, <Chip>Keywords</Chip>, <Chip>Publication year</Chip>,
            DOI, subject, category, document type and citation count. Fields marked * are required. A paper the
            classifier cannot place is left unsorted rather than filed under a default, and the document type is
            read from the citation itself (a BibTeX <Chip>@book</Chip>, an RIS <Chip>TY</Chip> code) so a book is not
            labeled a journal article. A year or citation count that is not a whole number is flagged before you save.
            The box on the right, <Chip>Recommendation Signal Validation</Chip>, lights each of the four
            signals the engine needs (title, abstract, keywords, publication year); a paper missing any
            of them is stored but flagged as needing review and excluded from rankings until fixed.

          <P>
            For a PDF, text and metadata are extracted with pdfplumber. The extraction is heuristic: a
            scanned PDF without a text layer extracts poorly because the system does no OCR, so check
            the abstract and keywords. If keywords are missing they are generated from the title and
            abstract with YAKE, and a subject and category are assigned from arXiv categories and
            keyword evidence when none is present.

            Re-imports are rejected across every route. An exact DOI match or a title similarity of at
            least 0.85 blocks the save with a message that names the existing record, and the review form
            warns you before you press Save ("Already in the repository: #…"). For
            citation-only imports the system looks for the best open-access PDF (Unpaywall, Crossref,
            Semantic Scholar, arXiv, OpenAlex) and attaches it automatically when a candidate clears
            the confidence bar.

          My Library is the personal shortlist, kept in the database so it survives between sessions.
          Save a paper from the Repository inspector (<Chip>Saved</Chip>), from the Recommend and Web
          results or from a graph, and it appears here; the badge on the top-bar tab counts them.
          The page has four tabs. In Library mode and in the free version, <Chip>Library</Chip> is open
          and the other three show a lock; in Researcher mode with Pro they are all live.

            <Chip>Dashboard</Chip> summarizes the collection: saved papers, the repository size and its
            number of subjects, how many papers are valid for ranking, and the document types; then
            papers by publication year in five-year bins, the subject spread, the most cited papers,
            the newest additions and the document-type counts.

            <Chip>Graph</Chip> lists your papers on the left; pick one and the graph draws its nearest
            neighbors in the whole repository (the <Chip>Neighbors</Chip> slider sets how many, up to 40).
            The edges use the active pipeline's own components, so the picture agrees with the ranking.
            <Chip>Cluster guides</Chip> color the zones in your theme's palette and attach each name with
            an animated leader line that ends in a circle; the labels are laid out so they never overlap.

            <Chip>Chat</Chip> is the research assistant. Choose where it searches (<Chip>Collection</Chip>,{" "}
            <Chip>Repository</Chip> or <Chip>Web</Chip>), ask a question, and the answer cites the sources
            it retrieved with numbered brackets, each with an <Chip>Open in library</Chip> button. The
            citation style follows Settings → Preferred citation style. A history sidebar keeps earlier
            chats; suggested questions appear under the answer. The assistant uses a hosted language
            model through a fallback chain; if the models are rate-limited it says so instead of
            guessing.
