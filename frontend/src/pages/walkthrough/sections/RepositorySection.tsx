          The Repository is the working surface of the system: it browses the stored corpus, searches
          it three ways and shows the engine's rankings, all on one screen. It reads the same SQLite
          database the recommendation engine uses, so a paper you edit here changes its next ranking
          after the index is rebuilt. The screen has three panes, each of which can be resized by
          dragging the thin handle between them: the <Chip>filter console</Chip> on the left, the{" "}

            the query representation from that paper's own prepared text and excludes it from the
            results. Free-text queries have no publication year, so the Metadata score tops out at 0.75

            Pipelines rank differently on purpose. In the example, the lexical pipeline puts "Neural
