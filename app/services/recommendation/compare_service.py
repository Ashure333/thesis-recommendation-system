"""
Pipeline comparison service ("Pipeline Battle").

Runs every implemented recommendation pipeline against the same
query or seed paper and returns the ranked results side by side,
so the Evaluation page can show which pipelines agree, disagree,
and which papers win across all of them.

For the thesis this is the raw material of the evaluation chapter:
consensus ranking, pairwise agreement, and per-pipeline rank
displacement are exactly the quantities reported when comparing
lexical / semantic / metadata / hybrid configurations.
