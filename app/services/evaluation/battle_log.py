"""
Battle-run export and statistics -- the Chapter IV aggregates.

``battle_runs`` is a flat table of one row per Arena battle, so every
question the evaluation chapter asks ("which pipeline wins text
queries", "does the hybrid still win within a single subject class",
"how often do the two lexical pipelines agree at top-10") is either a
group-by over that table or a reshape of the ``response_json`` blob
each row now carries.

Everything in this module is pure: it takes plain dicts (one per run)
and returns strings or dictionaries. No session, no file, no request.
The API layer supplies the rows and does the streaming, which keeps
the interesting part -- what a row means in the thesis -- testable
without a database or an HTTP client.

Two export shapes, deliberately different:

    - ``csv``:  one row per run, flattened and spreadsheet-friendly.
               The ranked lists are summed into counts and averages so
               the file stays wide-and-short; nothing is dropped that
               a cell could carry.
    - ``jsonl``: one JSON object per line, each carrying the run's
               ``response_json`` in full, so no computed structure is
               lost. The flattened numbers appear again as ``summary``
               so a consumer that only reads one shape still gets the
               headline figures.

The row dicts here carry the same keys ``GET /api/evaluation/battles``
returns, plus the research-log columns. ``query_kind`` is nullable
because the pre-campaign rows predate the backfill on some databases;
every aggregation treats a missing value as its own bucket rather than
dropping the run, since silently dropping data from a results table is
worse than an ``(untagged)`` label.
